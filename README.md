#Arduino Starter Project - Blinking LED
This is a project from my Arduino starter series.

In this project I'm going to make a connect a single LED on a breadboard connected to an Arduino Uno. This project is ideal for beginners who have grasped the basics of Arduino programming and prototyping but wish to learn something a little more advanced. Enjoy!

######Project Requirements
* Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
* USB cable to program Arduino
* Breadboard
* One LED (Any colour will do)
* One 220 Ohm Resistor
* Wires to power the components on the breadboard

######The Breadboard Setup
